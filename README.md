sujay-c/sujay-c** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ...

- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with ...

- âš¡ Fun fact: ...

 ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning various courses in my graduate program, but often get distracted as I read a lot about programming. At the crux of my persona, this defines me: someone knowledgeable about various concepts on a face-level, but no real in-depth knowledge. In short, I read too much and do too little. I'm trying to fix that. I have, what I think, is a solid grasp on Python and R, and I want to dive into more web development in my free time. I've been meaning to dive deeper into JavaScript for a while now but never really knew where to start. Obviously, the program I'm pursuing + looking and applying for jobs + networking + prepping for interviews takes up a lot of my time, but as the the spring semester comes to a close and graduation is looming in the horizon, I find myself hungry for more. I found a [Stanford course about web security](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs253/) created by [Feross](https://github.com/feross) which combines web development and web security, but it would probably be a little bit too advanced for me. However, after taking a closer look at the structure of the course, I really like how he has compiled the lecture notes + the videos are all available for free on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1y1iaEtjSYiiSGVlL1cHsXN_kvJOOhu-)! Eventually, I plan on building my own website, so I can make this about section a little less wordy and leave my GitHub for what it is supposed to be - a simple collection of my projects.

If you've read or even skimmed to the bottom to see this message, thank you!

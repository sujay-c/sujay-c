## Hello! Thank you for stopping by. :v:

- 🔭 - My name is Sujay Chebbi, and I’m currently working on pursuing a [Master of Science in Business Analytics](https://www.mccombs.utexas.edu/Master-of-Science-in-Business-Analytics) from the McCombs School of Business. Previously, I was employed at [ProLytX](https://www.prolytx.com), where I worked primarily on Piping & Instrumentation Diagrams (P&IDs) and general engineering design based around AutoCAD diagrams and spec sheets. It was unrelated to the career path I wanted to pursue, but I'm grateful for the opportunity for working there and gaining some kind of work experience at a small, burgeoning company at the intersection of Houston's IT and downstreem oil sectors. I completed a Bachelor of Science in Petroleum Engineering at Texas A&M University. At my heart, I am an Aggie, but I've come to love Austin and McCombs as it is!

- 💬 Ask me about (fantasy) basketball, movies, TV shows, music, fintech, the (US) stock market, pop science, and really anything in general!

- 📫 Feel free to find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sujaychebbi/) and shoot me a message. I am usually open to making new connections as long as we have a few mutuals!

If you've read or even skimmed to the bottom to see this message, thank you!

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ⚡ Fun fact: ...

 🌱 I’m currently learning various courses in my graduate program, but often get distracted as I read a lot about programming. At the crux of my persona, this defines me: someone knowledgeable about various concepts on a face-level, but no real in-depth knowledge. In short, I read too much and do too little. I'm trying to fix that. I have, what I think, is a solid grasp on Python and R, and I want to dive into more web development in my free time. I've been meaning to dive deeper into JavaScript for a while now but never really knew where to start. Obviously, the program I'm pursuing + looking and applying for jobs + networking + prepping for interviews takes up a lot of my time, but as the the spring semester comes to a close and graduation is looming in the horizon, I find myself hungry for more. I found a [Stanford course about web security](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs253/) created by [Feross](https://github.com/feross) which combines web development and web security, but it would probably be a little bit too advanced for me. However, after taking a closer look at the structure of the course, I really like how he has compiled the lecture notes + the videos are all available for free on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1y1iaEtjSYiiSGVlL1cHsXN_kvJOOhu-)! Eventually, I plan on building my own website, so I can make this about section a little less wordy and leave my GitHub for what it is supposed to be - a simple collection of my projects.
